 <h2><ol><li>Great socializing oppurtunity </li></ol></h2>
 <h3><p>Hobbies are a great way to socialize and meet new friends. Social hobbies facilitate bonds with others and add another layer of support to your life serving to reduce stress. Meet Up is a widely used platform for people to “meet new people, learn new things, find support, get out of their comfort zones, and pursue their passions, together” (Meetup, 2019, para. 1). There are dozens of groups in every city dedicated to all kinds of group activities. It is likely that you will find others interested in the same things you are, and there will be a meetup group already established. If not, you can create your own meetup group.</p></h3>
